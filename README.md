## Project Structure

The project follows a standard MVCS architecture with additional packages. All packages are stored within `bto/src/main/java/com/sc2002`:

*   `Main.java`: The main entry point of the application.
*   `model`: Contains the data model classes representing entities like `UserModel`, `BTOProjectModel`, `EnquiryModel`, etc.
*   `view`: Contains classes responsible for the console-based user interface (`mainAppView`, `ApplicantView`, etc.).
*   `controllers`: Handles user interactions and coordinates application flow (`AuthController`, `InitializationController`, etc.).
*   `services`: Implements the core business logic of the application (`AuthService`, `ProjectService`, etc.).
*   `repositories`: Manages data persistence and retrieval logic (`UserRepo`, `ProjectRepo`, etc.).
*   `interfaces`: Defines common interfaces, like `RepoInterface` used to define a contract to repositories.

Other packages:
*   `config`: Contains application context and configuration classes (`AppContext`).
*   `enums`: Defines enumeration types used across the application (e.g., `UserRole`, `ApplicationStatus`).
*   `utilities`: Provides helper functions and utility classes (`CSVReader`, validators).
